# Online-Product-Sales-Dashboard

The Online Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales and profitability across products, categories, and regions. At the top, KPI cards summarize the key metrics:

   Total Sales = 13,292,518

   Total Profit = 2,352,317

   Average Discount = 12.41%

These KPIs allow for a quick snapshot of business performance.

The Sales by Sub-Region map highlights the geographic distribution of sales across different cities in India, showing stronger sales in certain urban centers.

A pie chart shows Sales by Category, where Electronics (23.39%) and Home Decor (23.58%) contribute the largest share, followed by Beauty, Kitchen, and Clothing.

The bar chart of Quantity (bin) vs. Sales shows how sales volume increases with higher quantities, segmented by product category.

The Monthly Sales Trend line chart tracks sales performance across months (Januaryâ€“June 2024), showing fluctuations by category. This helps in identifying seasonal peaks and low-demand months.

Finally, the Profit by Product bar chart ranks products by profitability, with Jackets, Nail Polish, and Wireless Mouse among the top performers, while Dinner Sets and Bluetooth Speakers show lower profits.

Interactive filters (Region, Category, Profit range) allow users to explore specific segments, making the dashboard dynamic and insightful for decision-making.
